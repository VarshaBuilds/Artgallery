The Art Gallery Web Application is designed to digitally showcase a collection of artworks from various artists and genres, making art accessible to a wider audience. The platform allows users to view, interact with, and appreciate art pieces, and it offers a separate interface for administrators to manage the content, including artworks, artists, and exhibitions. This project is aimed at providing art enthusiasts with an immersive browsing experience and enhancing engagement with artists.
